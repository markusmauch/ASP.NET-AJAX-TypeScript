# asp.net.ajax.ts

## TypeScript port ot the Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX framework (MicrosoftAjax.js)

This is a complete reimplmentation of the ASP.NET Ajax framework using TypeScript.
The goal of this project is to be as compatible as possible with the API of the original framework while the implementation behind the API is being refactored and optimized.

This library might be helpful for anyone having the intention to migrate large web applications that are built on top of the ASP.NET Ajax framework to TypeScript.

Some parts of the original library as the class registration / derivation system are obsolete using TypeScript and are not supported.
